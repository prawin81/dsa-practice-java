# 🧠 DSA Practice in Java – Topic-wise Solutions

Welcome to my personal DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Java repository!  
This repo contains **topic-wise solutions** to popular coding problems from platforms like **LeetCode, CodeStudio, GFG**, and more.  
I created this to build strong DSA skills and track my journey — one question at a time.
